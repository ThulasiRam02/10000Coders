             Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer who plays for India national cricket team. He was born in Delhi, India on November 5,               1988. Virat is the first player in ICC cricket history to win all 3 ICC awards in a single year- ICC , ODI player of the              year, ICC Test player of the year and ICC Player of the year award in 2008
             Kohli's playing style is widely regarded as aggressive, a trait that extends to his leadership on the field. Kohli is                  known as a skilled batsman who plays with determination and energy. In one-day cricket, he usually bats at number three               and stands with his chest slightly open and holds the bottom of his bat firmly. He's praised for his quick footwork,                    wide range of shots, and his talent for leading innings, especially in high-pressure situations. Instead of trying to                  hit big shots, Kohli prefers to play safe shots close to the ground. People admire his ability to make wrist shots and                 consistently perform well in the mid-wicket and cover areas. Kohli is known for his composed batting technique and                     versatility in his play. He scores runs between long-off and long-on with an aligned bat, while also possessing the                    ability to display a destructive streak. His combination of bat-speed and supple wrist movements enable him to craft                   innovative angles that disrupt traditional field positioning.
